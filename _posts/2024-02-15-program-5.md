```c++
// This program asks for the user to enter the starting size of a population, the annual birth rate, the annual death rate, and the number of years to display. 
// Following user input, the program should calculate the size of the population for a year using the formula:
// 
// N = P + BP - DP
// 
// N = New Population Size
// P = Previous Population Size
// B = Birth Rate
// D = Death Rate
// 
// Input Validations: 
// Do not accept numbers less than 2 for the starting size. 
// Do not accept negative numbers for birth rate or death rate.
// Do not accept numbers less than 1 for the number of years. 
//
