#Write a class named Employee that holds the following data about an employee in attributes: name, ID number, department, and job title.
#Once you have written the class, write a program that creates three Employee objects to hold the following data.
#The program should store this data in the three objects, then display the data for each employee on the screen.
#Susan Meyers 47899 Accounting Vice President
#Mark Jones 39119 IT Programmer
#Joy Rogers 81774 Manufacturing Engineer
