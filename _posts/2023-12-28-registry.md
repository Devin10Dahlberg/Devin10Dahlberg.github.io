title: "Registry - Windows Security Account Manager"
layout: post
---
Summary:
  1. Identify the location of the file
  2. Learn what type of data the Security Account Manager (SAM) file stores
  3. Learn how to parse them
  4. Understand how to corroborate findings in the registry with files on the source device
  5. Attempt to crack the users in the SAM

To begin this exercise I launched a Windows OS virtual machine and logged into the administrator account.

Once logged into the VM I launched the application FTK Imager from the Windows menu and became familiar with the applications menus by locating the Evidence Tree, File List, Properties, and View Pane.

I next selected a file from the C Drive to upload the file as evidence.

This allowed me to add the file to the Evidence Tree Pane and nagivate throughout the file.

I next moved throughout the file to the root folder, then within the root folder I moved to the WINDOWS folder, then within the WINDOWS folder I moved to the system32 folder. Within the system32 folder, I was able to locate the config folder. 

Once inside the config folder, I changed my focus to the File List Pane where I located and exported the SAM and system files to a newly created file on the Desktop called "shared".

I then navigated to the Desktop and launched the shared folders properties window and in advance sharing I reduced the number of users that can access the shared folder to one.

For the next portion of the exercise, I launched a Kali Linux virtual machine and logged into the root account and launched terminal emulator.

From here I created a folder similar to the WinOS with the command:

  - mkdir Desktop/share

I then mounted the shared folder from the Windows VM to the created folder in Kali Linux with the command:

  - sudo mount -t cifs -v -o user=Administrator,password=Train1ng\$,vers=2.1 //192.168.0.20/Users/Administrator/Desktop/shared /root/Desktop/share/

I then created a new folder named Lab22 and copied the contents from share to the newly created folder:

I next began to extract passwords from the SAM file by launching the application samdump2.

Once the terminal emulator application was open I entered the command:

  -  samdump2 -o Desktop/Lab22/hash.txt Desktop/Lab22/system Desktop/Lab22/SAM

This command fetches the SYSKEY and extracts the hashes from the SAM file, and outputs the parsed data to the provided file.

I then looked at the parsed results by navigating the Lab22 folder and opening hash.txt

From here I recognized that for Mr. Evil and the Admin account both hashes are the same. This means that the passwords are identical.

I then returned to the terminal emulator and entered the command:

  - john --format=LM --wordlist= /usr/share/john/password.lst Desktop/Lab22/hash.txt

which resulted in:

This showed me that the results indicate that the password is: 123456
