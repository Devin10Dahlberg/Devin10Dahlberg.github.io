Summary: 
  1. Becoming Familiar with OpenVAS
  2. Quick Scanning with OpenVAS
  3. Customized Scanning with OpenVAS

To begin this exercise I launched a Kali Linux virtual machine and logged into the root account. Once logged in, I launched the application OpenVAS and logged into a Greenbone Security Assistant acount.

Once I completed a quick scan, I began to configure a scan by choosing "Full and very deep ultimate" scan, and configured a target by entering the name, hosts, and IP address.
